## Abstract

This proposal details a local, grassroots redevelopment of the former Beacon Correctional Facility into a community education, materials, manufacturing, information technology, and arts resource.


## Motivation

This proposal is motivated by a desire to activate this valuable, long-dormant property to the direct benefit of Beacon residents.

## Criticism of Existing Initiatives

Despite the fact that Empire State Development previously accepted a 2019 proposal from Urban Green Food [[1](https://esd.ny.gov/esd-media-center/press-releases/beacon-redevelopment-dutchess-county)] for the redevelopment of this property, no apparent progress has been made toward the realization of this plan, which focuses on conventional commercial and trourism-centric development, as opposed to the community-centric purposes that this document proposes. Complicating the realization of the Urban Green Food plan is the lack of convenient vehicular access to this property, with the SW approach of Matteawan Rd. as the only public ingress. Mayor Lee Kyriacou has proposed to address this through the construction of a new road [[2](https://highlandscurrent.org/2022/08/05/progress-slow-at-camp-beacon/)]:

> Under Kyriacou’s plan, a road would be constructed from Route 52, diverging near the long driveway that leads to the Chemprene manufacturing facility, winding around the perimeter of the prison’s land and connecting with Matteawan Road, creating another point of entry to Camp Beacon.

...

> For the proposal to move forward, he hopes the state will provide its $6 million for the road.

... 

> “My focus is on doing the one thing that would change the potential for that site, which is road access,” Kyriacou said. “Anything that follows that would be a big plus.”

We contend that the existing location and accessibility is adequate to accomodate a local, community-centric purpose similar to that which we propose, making it possible to instead apply that $6M toward the material development of the proposal itself.

Beacon resident Mark Roland spoke at a recent City Council meeting [[3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vR5edWUJAYc&t=1217s)] expressing disappointment over the lack of progress at the site and advocating that the City of Beacon take control of the Beacon Correctional Facility property:
> Rather than stockpiling more stores for our out-of-town visitors, or waiting for yet another Request for Proposal from the state to be awarded to yet another outside developer stepping in to tell us what they will do, we need to do it ourselves together. We need to create space to grow food and make things, create alternative career paths for our kids and build some resilience into our economy that does not rely exclusively on out-of-town visitors. We should make immediate arrangements to have Common Ground farm as a long-term tenant so they can begin rehabilitating the soil. We should put together a board to manage the selection process for other qualified local businesses that would apply for space in one of the 22 buildings on the site. We could have our grant writer seek grants. We should immediately apply for the $6M that was set aside when the prison closed to help repurpose the land. This can be held in an escrow account and managed by the city administrator and the board. It's coming up on 10 years since the prison closed and a group of citizens tried to get a plan like this enacted. We had the school district, Common Ground, and a number of small businesses and non-profits on-board, but without the city backing us, there was no way to get the state to take our proposal seriously. Meanwhile, the buildings are unmaintained and the ground is fallow to this day. It's a ridiculous situation that needs to be rectified now. We've made plenty of mistakes with our commonly-held property in the past 20 years. If we do this right, for the people who live here, we can make up for all of that, and then some.

## Functions

### Repair Cafe

Repair Cafe is an established movement that empowers communities with the ability to repair "objects of everyday life such as electrical and mechanical devices, computers, bicycles, clothing, and other items." [[4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repair_Caf%C3%A9)]

Antony Tseng started a Beacon Repair Cafe in 2016 [[5](http://www.repaircafehv.org/beacon)] which was active for several years but is now dormant due to competing life obligations. Our plan will create a perpetual Repair Cafe that is able to leverage, and be leveraged by, the <a href="#e-waste-recycling-and-recovery-hub">E-Waste Recycling and Recovery Hub</a> and <a href="#materials-and-tool-depot">Materials and Tool Depot</a>.


### E-Waste Recycling and Recovery Hub

We will serve as a community hub for the disposal of E-waste such as computer equipment, consumer electronics, and household appliances. These materials will follow one of three tracks:

1. The object will be restored to a working condition in collaboration with the <a href="#repair-cafe">Repair Cafe</a> and made available again to the community, either directly via the <a href="#materials-and-tool-depot">Materials and Tool Depot</a> or through integration into one of our other functions
2. The object will be salavaged for parts that will be catalogued and submitted into the <a href="#materials-and-tool-depot">Materials and Tool Depot</a> inventory, with any remaining, unusable materials sent for waste collection
3. The object will be sent for waste collection


### Plastic Waste Collection Hub

Following the Precious Plastic [[6](https://preciousplastic.com/)] model, we will serve as a community hub for the dropoff of Polypropylene (PP #5) and Polyethylene (HDPE #2, LDPE #4) plastic waste, as well as consume appropriate <a href="#e-waste-recycling-and-recovery-hub">E-Waste Recycling and Recovery Hub</a> outputs, which we will sort, grind, and store to serve as injection molding stock for the <a href="#interface-research-lab">Interface Research Lab</a>. 


#### Disassembly Workshops

The salavging of e-waste will provide an opportunity for residents, specifically young adults, to participate in the educational, hands-on process of disassembling electronic devices to discover the hidden inner workings and identify and recover useful components. Learning how objects are constructed through manual disassembly helps build physical dexterity, establishes an understanding of how things work, and provides insight into the designer's mindset, all of which may serve to inspire future invention and creation. 


### Materials and Tool Depot

We will accumulate and maintain a catalogued inventory of consumable and non-consumable material goods that will be made available to the community at low or no cost, to either own or borrow, depending on the nature of the object. Materials will be procured through direct purchase, donations, and Repair Cafe outputs.

Examples of objects in each of these classes:

- Consumables
  - raw materials (e.g. shredded plastic, scrap metal)
  - construction materials (e.g. wood, sheet metal, bar stock)
  - fasteners (e.g. screws, nails, bolts)
  - electro-mechanical components (e.g. discretes, sensors, switches, motors, lights, speakers, microphones)
- Non-Consumables
  - hand tools (e.g. screwdrivers, hammers, saws, wrenches)
  - power tools (e.g. drills, circular saws, grinders)
  - electronics (e.g. computers, phones, cameras, radios)
  - appliances (e.g. lamps, blenders)
  - test equipment (e.g. force gauges, oscilloscopes, multimeters, logic analyzers)

The depot's non-consumable inventory could serve as an extension of the Howland Library's existing Library of Things [[7](https://beaconlibraryofthings.weebly.com/)].

### Data Center

So much of our modern social and productive lives rely on information technology infrastructure into which we have little visibility, and over which we have no control. Many community sustainability plans overlook the need for locally-managed information technology systems. To address this, we will construct a small-scale local data center from low-cost commodity hardware and open-source technologies that will be available to the community for:
- hosting personal and business websites
- running social media sites and forums
- storing files
- a learning environment for web designers and software developers

### Interface Research Lab

We will create a community technology education and digital fabrication facility which, in many ways, resembles a typical makerspace [[8](https://www.makerspaces.com/what-is-a-makerspace/)], whose primary function is to facilitate community access to specialized tools and materials, but will differ in its project-driven nature and primary motivation "to help prepare our community for the future of work and industry through education in the concepts and tools of modern technology and participation in an exploratory process of new, local industry creation."
