# Beacon Correctional Facility Proposal

## Abstract

This proposal details a local, grassroots redevelopment of the former Beacon Correctional Facility into a community education, materials, manufacturing, information technology, and arts resource.


## Motivation

This proposal is motivated by a desire to activate this valuable, long-dormant property to the direct benefit of Beacon residents.

Despite the fact that Empire State Development previously accepted a 2019 proposal from Urban Green Food [[1](https://esd.ny.gov/esd-media-center/press-releases/beacon-redevelopment-dutchess-county)] for the redevelopment of this property, no apparent progress has been made toward the realization of this plan, which focuses on conventional commercial and trourism-centric development, as opposed to the community-centric purposes that this document proposes. Complicating the realization of the Urban Green Food plan is the lack of convenient vehicular access to this property, with the SW approach of Matteawan Rd. as the only public ingress. Mayor Lee Kyriacou has proposed to address this through the construction of a new road [[2](https://highlandscurrent.org/2022/08/05/progress-slow-at-camp-beacon/)]:

> Under Kyriacou’s plan, a road would be constructed from Route 52, diverging near the long driveway that leads to the Chemprene manufacturing facility, winding around the perimeter of the prison’s land and connecting with Matteawan Road, creating another point of entry to Camp Beacon. ... For the proposal to move forward, he hopes the state will provide its $6 million for the road.

We contend that the existing location and accessibility is adequate to accomodate a local, community-centric purpose similar to that which we propose, making it possible to instead apply that $6M toward the material development of the proposal itself.
